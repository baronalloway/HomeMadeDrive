##HomeMade Drive

This program creates a backup of a specified folder on the computer, and stores it on any FTP server. Sync happens when user commands it to. This program will require some editing for personal use (such as file paths) but is free for use. It works similar to “Google Drive”.

The folder is copied completely and stored on the FTP server, and removed from the server when the file is removed from the local folder.

This project uses FTP4J, a free Java-FTP plugin that can be obtained at the link below.
